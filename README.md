# Project Auth

An API with authentication and registration, and a frontend with forms to register, sign in, and view some content once the user is logged in.

## The problem

Pair programming project where we started with the backend creating a Mongoose model for the user and endpoints to create user and log in. When logged in the user can access information stored in a third endpoint that needs authorization. The frontend consists of two forms, one for sign up and one for sign in. When successfully signed in the secret page is displayed.

If we had more time we would allowed the user to post information to the database.
